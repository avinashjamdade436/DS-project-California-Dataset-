# DS-project-California-Dataset-
Project : "California Housing Dataset Analysis"

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn. 

In this project, I analyzed the California housing dataset to gain insights into housing trends and patterns. I collected and organized the data using Python and Pandas, and used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations to better understand the data.

I identified outliers and used data cleansing techniques to prepare the data for analysis. I used data visualization techniques to observe the correlation between features. Additionally, I used my proficiency in programming constructs to create a user-defined function to calculate skewness and kurtosis values.

Overall, my analysis of the California housing dataset showcases my strong proficiency in data analysis, data cleansing and preprocessing techniques, and my ability to use Python and associated libraries to gain insights and draw conclusions from complex datasets.
